<h1>Observation Guide</h1>
<Linkable e="h3" id="introduction">Introduction</Linkable>
<p>Make sure you are familiar with the constitution so you can evaluate the server in line with the TCN's expectations and requirements:</p>
<p><A to="/info/constitution" external>{PUBLIC_DOMAIN}/info/constitution</A></p>
<p>
    The purpose of this document is to provide a guide for observations; however, not everything here should be seen as requirements as every situation will be
    different, and it is not comprehensive or exhaustive and adapting to the server is a vital part of successful observations. Remember that you can ask for
    help at any time! Only one observer watches a server, but we are a team, and you can ask any questions you have to ensure a smooth observation period.
</p>
<Linkable e="h3" id="before-you-observe">Before You Observe</Linkable>
<p>Ensure the following:</p>
<ul class="space">
    <li>
        <b>You are not involved in the server.</b> Involvement includes any staff position, positions close to management such as advisor positions, particular closeness
        with admins in the server, or anything else that reasonably results in you being biased or may result in people believing your observation is biased and
        not objective. If in doubt, ask the other observers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>You are not a minor observing a server with an NSFW section.</b> The NSFW section must be observed as it is integral that it is regulated well. If you
        are a minor, you are obviously not permitted to access that section, so you will not be able to observe the server fully.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once the candidate is approved for observation and has been assigned to you, contact them and let them know they can check the list of observers on
    <A to="/contact">{PUBLIC_DOMAIN}/contact</A>.
</p>
<p>Make sure you request the following:</p>
<ul class="space">
    <li><b>View</b> access for <b>all</b> channels in the server.</li>
    <li>Access to the audit logs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Also, establish a clear timeline of the observation, as in when it will end (you can use <A to="https://timeanddate.com" external>timeanddate.com</A> to quickly
    calculate; <A to="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/dateadded.html?ad=28" external>this link</A> is pre-filled to show 28 days after the current date when you
    click it). If they have any questions about the timeline or the process, you can point them to Section 8 of the rules, the summary in the application form itself,
    or if you can't answer them, ask another observer or point them to the Hub.
</p>
<Linkable e="h3" id="during-observation">During Observation</Linkable>
<p>
    Take note of the server's environment. This includes both the staff environment and the public community. If you see things that happened before your
    observation period but haven't been explicitly addressed or resolved, feel free to include them as well, but read until the end of this document.
</p>
<p>Additionally, keep a log of things that go on during the observation. This includes:</p>
<ul class="space">
    <li>Incoming or outgoing staff.</li>
    <li>Ongoing server events.</li>
    <li>Notable changes to structure and/or rules.</li>
    <li>Critical decisions that you believe highlight the server's function, either positive or negatively.</li>
    <li>Staff conflicts and how they are handled.</li>
    <li>Significant events within public channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If changes happen to the network, e.g. a change to rules, make sure you communicate that to the candidate, and make sure you stay up-to-date on current
    affairs in HQ and the latest version of the rules.
</p>
<p>Finally, if there are questions the network or the server would like to relay to each other, you are the primary contact point.</p>
<Linkable e="h3" id="after-observation">After Observation</Linkable>
<Linkable e="h5" id="writing-the-reports">Writing the Report</Linkable>
<p>
    Make sure your report includes all of the aforementioned notes that you made during your observation. Additionally, you do not need to include a full server
    structure outline, but include a list of "features" the server has (e.g. leaks section, theorycrafting, NSFW, etc.) as well as any notable deviations from
    normal server setup (e.g. no dedicated mod or admin channel, shared staff channel with a sister/partner server, etc.).
</p>
<p>Some other things you should include:</p>
<ul class="space">
    <li>
        For leaked characters or characters that have not been confirmed as playable, include the source of confirmation for their playability and information
        on why the leaks should be considered reliable. Leaked characters that have not appeared in official media are considered spoilers and generally should
        not be inducted until later. Characters that officially exist whose playability is not confirmed are permitted to be inducted with reliable evidence of
        their future playability.
    </li>
    <li>
        Include notable staff activity, e.g. event planning, art staff work, the team's responsiveness to upper management and spontaneous occurrences (e.g. the
        mod team's response time, effectiveness, and efficiency).
    </li>
</ul>
<Linkable e="h5" id="open-communication">Open Communication</Linkable>
<p>
    Post your reports to <Mention type="text">reports</Mention> in HQ and update the status of the candidate's post in
    <Mention type="forum">applicants</Mention> to <b>Observation Finished</b>. (You may have to search for the post since it likely will be auto-archived before
    your observation is complete.)
</p>
<p>
    If you have any concerns with the server or questions you want to ask them, e.g. regarding behavior predating your observation and what the server's stance
    or state on that is now, list them out in the forum post. Other people may add or revise questions as well and based on the report, generate their own
    concerns or comments. Maintain open communication between the server and the network to clear up all misunderstandings and ensure the server is evaluated as
    fairly as possible.
</p>
<Linkable e="h5" id="voting">Voting</Linkable>
<p>
    Once the question period is over and everyone is satisfied with the communication, start a vote for the server. If you're not sure how to start a vote, read
    the section related to votes in the <A to="/docs/observer-onboarding#votes">Observer Onboarding Guide</A>.
