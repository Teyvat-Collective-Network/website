<h1>Observer Tasks</h1>
<p>
    The purpose of this document is to create a list of roles and areas that are primarily observer-driven and assign ownership to observers. This is not a
    strict division that restricts what observers are allowed to do, but rather places responsibility, authority, and leadership in the hands of people who want
    to take on specific tasks.
